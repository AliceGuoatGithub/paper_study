Abstract

In recent years, the research and application of quadrotor UAVs have attracted more and more attention. Due to its simple structure and good performance, quadrotor UAVs are increasingly used in many aspects, such as military investigation and rescue,civil life and so on. 

Correspondingly, the safety of quadrotor UAVs must be guaranteed during the irutilization. One of the important reasons for a UAV’s explosion during its flight is that it cannot avoid obstacles on the flight path. Thus,  the development of obstacle avoidance technology has always been a key issue in the research of UAVs’ applications. Based on the work done by the predecessors, this paper focuses on the research of obstacle avoidance technology for quadrotorUAVs. The main content softhe paper are as follows: 

(1) This paper introduces some basic knowledge,  including the coordinate system commonly used by quadrotor UAVs, the flight attitude representation, the internal communication mechanism of a UAV flight control.At same time, the basic structure and flight principle of quadrotor UAVs are analyzed.  Finally, the mathematical model of the quadrotorUAVisestablished.

 (2) In this paper, the overall design of the obstacle avoidance system is provided.First, the obstacle avoidance process and the required modules are developed. Then some related work about the obstacle detection and visual inspection is introduced.Finally,  for the needs of the obstacle avoidance,  the platform of the quadrotor UAV is selected and established.In addition, thes oftware environmen trequired for the secondary development is configured. 

(3) The A* algorithm and the artificial potential field algorithm are respectively established. The advantages and drawbacks between the A* algorithm and the artificial potential field algorithm are pointed out by comparisons. The defects of the traditional artificial potential field algorithm are carefully analyzed. And the improved methods are proposed for the corresponding defects.

 (4)This paper introduces the data fusion of height data based on complementary filtering and the data fusion of attitude data,and deals with the actual flight altitude and flight attitude of the UAV.Under the position control, the process of height control and attitude control is studied,thendesignedaheight and attitudecascade PID controller isd esigned.

 (5) The simulation model of quadrotor UAV is built up,and the altitude controller andattitude controller are given also. The A* algorithm and the traditional artificial potential field algorithm are both simulated to observe the paths. Also, the proposed method based on the artificial potential field algorithm is realized by examples. Finally, the actual flight experimentiscarriedoutbymeansoftheexperimentalplatform.
